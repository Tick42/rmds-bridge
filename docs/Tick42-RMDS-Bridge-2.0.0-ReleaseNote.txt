Release note, version 2.0.0:

- added configuration for asynchronous messaging activation; the default value is false (synchronous messaging as it was);
- fixed function call in order to optimize call-stack usage;
- midified some of the build scripts - cmake scripts for the Linux builds, and MSBuild scripts for the Windows builds.
